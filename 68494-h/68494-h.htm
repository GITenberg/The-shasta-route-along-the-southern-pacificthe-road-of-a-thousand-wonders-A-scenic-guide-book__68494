<h2 id="toc" class="nobreak"><i>EXPLANATION OF VIEWS ILLUSTRATED</i></h2>

<h3><a href="#cover">MOUNT SHASTA FROM RESERVOIR LAKE (COVER)</a></h3>

<p>This is one of the most famous views of this imperial mountain peak.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_3">THE FERRY BUILDING</a></h3>

<p>From the Ferry Building, at the foot of Market Street, the ferry boats of the
Southern Pacific take the traveler across San Francisco Bay to Oakland Pier. The
Ferry Building, erected in 1896 at a cost of $1,000,000, is the water gate of San
Francisco, where rail and tide meet. There is scarcely a minute in the day when there
is not a ferry either arriving at or departing from some one of the ferry slips.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_4">VIEW OF SAN FRANCISCO, SHOWING THE HARBOR, OAKLAND,
AND MOUNT DIABLO IN THE DISTANCE</a></h3>

<p>San Francisco, the starting point of this journey, is the largest and best known
of the cities on the Pacific Coast. This bird’s eye view of lower San Francisco, the
Ferry Building and San Francisco Bay, shows the splendid body of water facing the
city. This Bay is seventy miles long and from three to ten miles wide, and has an
area of four hundred and fifty square miles. Vessels of all descriptions, and from all
parts of the globe, populate San Francisco harbor, which is the pride and marvel of
all navigators. Yerba Buena Island is seen on the left, the trans-bay cities of Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda, and ferryboat landings in the middle distance, while in the
distance is seen Mount Diablo.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_5">OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA</a></h3>

<p>Oakland, the third largest city in California is but eighteen minutes from San
Francisco via the Southern Pacific’s fine transbay steamers.</p>

<p>With its fine harbor facilities, Oakland is rapidly growing as a commercial center,
carrying on an extensive coastwise and foreign trade. Its position on the east side of
the bay, makes it a great railroad terminal for all lines from the north, south and east.</p>

<p>As a community of homes, Oakland has a well deserved fame, for its setting is
picturesque and the climate nears perfection.</p>

<p>Oakland has many attractive parks and public playgrounds. Lake Merritt, near
the Civic Center is a natural water-park, and state game reserve, where thousands of
wild ducks make their winter home, an unusual sight, indeed. Boating may be
enjoyed every day in the year.</p>

<p>Oakland’s City Hall, with its massive tower, is the tallest building in California,
its height being 377 feet.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_6">FERRY BOAT “CONTRA COSTA”</a></h3>

<p>This ferry carries Southern Pacific trains and passengers between Port Costa and
Benicia, crossing the Carquinez Straits. The distance is about a mile and requires
about twenty minutes. The ferry was constructed as a sister ship to the ferry “Solano”
and is the largest ferry in the world. It is 433 feet long, cost $450,000, and has a
capacity of 36 cars and two engines.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_7">LASSEN PEAK, LASSEN VOLCANIC NATIONAL PARK</a></h3>

<p>Lassen Peak, California, is the latest scene of volcanic activity on the Pacific
Coast, adding another point of interest along “The Road of a Thousand Wonders.”
Lassen Peak with its elevation of 10,577 feet, can be seen from the car windows of
the “Shasta Route” trains, and can be visited from Red Bluff or Redding by automobile.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_8">SACRAMENTO RIVER AND MT. SHASTA FROM CASTELLA</a></h3>

<p>This is one of the finest views in the canyon, with the mighty form of Mt. Shasta
in the background. The great white cap extends 14,444 feet above the sea. The
foothill counties tributary to this valley are rich in gold and other minerals, while
the rich soil of the entire valley is adapted to raising of a most diverse variety of crops.
The upper canyon of the Sacramento River constantly presents to the traveler an ever-changing
scene of astounding splendor.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_9">CASTLE CRAGS IN SACRAMENTO CANYON</a></h3>

<p>Castle Crags, in the Sacramento Canyon, are great granite rocks, rising close beside
the track, to a height of 4,000 feet. Their vertical strata splintered into a hundred
parapets, makes this a scene never to be forgotten. Beyond the Crags is Castle Lake
at an elevation of 7,245 feet, and from this point appears the rounded summit of Mt.
Shasta, silver against the turquoise sky; a watch tower of the world, gazing ever
toward the eternal.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_10">MOSSBRAE FALLS AT SHASTA SPRINGS</a></h3>

<p>Here one of the enormous streams which have their origin in the melting snows
of Mt. Shasta, divides itself into a myriad of little waterways before reaching the top
of a wooded semi-circular cliff, from which point it tumbles into the Sacramento
River, a hundred feet below, forming Mossbrae Falls, as they appear like a thousand
springs born under the rocky ground.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_11">SHASTA SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA</a></h3>

<p>Shasta Springs, near the base of Mount Shasta, is one of the best-known all-the-year-around
resorts in the world. Here the train stops long enough for a drink of
the famous sparkling Shasta water, real soda water. This resort is noted for its
scenic beauty and its health-giving water.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_12">CANTARA LOOP, 18TH CROSSING, SACRAMENTO RIVER, CALIFORNIA</a></h3>

<p>The train spends five hours crossing and recrossing the Sacramento River. This
loop was devised to get out of the canyon and up on the plateau where stands Mt.
Shasta, with its snowy summit, as seen from the car windows; nothing could be a more
glorious tribute to the marvelous skill of the modern railroad engineer, than the
obstacles met with and overcome in building a railroad through this rugged country.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_13">SISSON, AT THE BASE OF MOUNT SHASTA</a></h3>

<p>At this point the traveler finds himself at the base of the mountain, and if he
desires, can arrange a genuine Alpine mountain climbing trip. The town stands at
the base of the mountain and a road runs to the edge of the timber line, which has
made possible an ascent of the mountain in a single day. The wonderful view from
the summit, 14,444 feet above the sea, is bounded only by the curvature of the
world’s disc, and there is not a finer view to be had anywhere.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_14">PANORAMA OF MT. SHASTA AND BLACK BUTTE</a></h3>

<p>There are numerous volcanic cones scattered throughout this part of California.
One of the best-known is Black Butte, also called Muirs Peak. Its cone is almost
perpendicular to a height of almost 6,000 feet, close to the base of Mt. Shasta—black,
bare and desolate, an extinct volcano, with half a dozen craters in plain view. Mt.
Shasta is an extinct volcano, one of the highest peaks on the North American Continent.
Its snows and glaciers feed hundreds of streams which thread the wild region
in every direction. These wild regions are a paradise for the sportsman and lover of
nature. Grizzly, black and cinnamon bear abound, elk, deer and mountain sheep are
plenty, as well as a great variety of smaller game. The streams are alive with trout.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_15">MOUNT SHASTA FROM EDGEWOOD</a></h3>

<p>Here is one of the favorite view points of this great snow-capped mountain and
where the majestic grandeur of the mountain is most apparent. Edgewood, as the
name suggests, is literally the edge of the forest. From this point to the summit of
the Siskiyous there is very little timber.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_16">MT. McLOUGHLIN FROM UPPER KLAMATH LAKE</a></h3>

<p>The Klamath Country has no superior as a pleasure realm for the sportsman and
camper, and of unusual interest to tourists. Much of this region is still a wilderness,
full of the charm of mountain and forest. Its marches are breeding grounds for wild
fowl; its clear streams and broad lakes are full of lusty, hard-fighting trout, and in its
forests roam deer, bear and cougars. Mount McLoughlin, the highest peak in southern
Oregon, is 9,760 feet above sea level.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_17">WIZARD ISLAND, CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK</a></h3>

<p>Crater Lake lies in the heart of the Cascade Range, in southern Oregon, its surface
6,177 feet above sea level. As its name suggests, it is the crater of an extinct volcano.
Crater Lake has been sounded to a depth of 1,996 feet and declared by scientists to be
the deepest inland body of water in the world. Rising almost sheer from the water’s
edge, the rim of the lava cliffs attain at places a height of 2,000 feet. From Crater
Lake Lodge, on the rim of the lake, the opposite shore is six miles away. Wizard
Island is a perfectly preserved cinder cone rising nearly 1,000 feet above the lake.
You may climb the slaggy timbered cone of Wizard Island and descend one hundred
feet into its crater which is five hundred feet across.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_18">LOOP TUNNELS 14 AND 15 IN SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS</a></h3>

<p>This picture represents one of the difficulties of railroads through this rugged
mountain range and shows elevation is overcome by the use of tunnels. A tunnel
is cut through the rocks; a circuit is made leading back to the same point at a higher
elevation and another tunnel is cut directly over the first one. The traveler will find
this a most interesting view as the train winds its way through these mountains.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_19">GOLD RAY DAM, SHOWING TABLE MOUNTAIN AND ROGUE RIVER</a></h3>

<p>Table Rock is familiar in Indian history as the place where Captain Jack of the
Modoc Indians made his last stand; was captured and hung at Old Fort Klamath,
ending the historical Modoc war. Snow-capped Mt. Pitt, rising to an altitude of
9,760 feet, is visible from this point.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_20">HELL GATE, ROGUE RIVER</a></h3>

<p>This picture shows the character of the upper stretches of this splendid trout
stream. Anglers cross the continent for the joys of fishing this stream. The line of
the Shasta Route from Medford to Crater Lake follows this canyon and affords many
beautiful views.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_21">COW CREEK CANYON</a></h3>

<p>Despite its unromantic title, this canyon has few rivals in the attractiveness of its
scenery. For a long way, the tracks run parallel to the stream, which races in rapid
rivalry with the train. Its rugged walls on every hand form grotesque outlines, suggesting
weird figures to the imagination of a nature-loving mind.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_22">THE WILLIAMETTE RIVER, OREGON</a></h3>

<p>The Southern Pacific “Shasta Route” follows for 150 miles, the beautiful
Williamette River, and from the car windows, may be glimpsed views of its wooded
banks, its gleaming reaches and winding course that will delight the beholder. The
Williamette Valley through which it flows is the principal valley of Western Oregon.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_23">MOUNT HOOD FROM LOST LAKE</a></h3>

<p>This mountain is often spoken of as the “Pride of Oregon.” Its uppermost
peak reaches an altitude of 11,225 feet and is plainly visible from many points on
this part of “The Road of a Thousand Wonders.” While this grand mountain is
easy to climb, the ascent is steep and the alpenstock and rope are used to aid one in
his upward journey. On the top one finds a region of perpetual snow, but the view
is indescribably grand. The trip to the summit is one of the most popular trips out
of Portland.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_24">PORTLAND, OREGON. MOUNT HOOD IN DISTANCE</a></h3>

<p>Portland, often termed the “Rose City,” has many natural advantages and points
of interest to the traveler. This popular name is derived from the city’s beautiful
parks and homes, where roses are in abundance everywhere. A trip up the Columbia
River from Portland will leave an impression on the traveler never to be forgotten.
Mountain climbing and ocean bathing are popular sports that help to make Portland
a favorite stopping point.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
